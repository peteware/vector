# Understanding STL

I want to understand the Standard Template Library (STL) in excruciating detail and
the best way is to implement it.  I'm starting off with `std::vector` as it is
relatively simple algorithmitically but a fundamental container.

This is not intended for production use.  It is targetting C++-17 with
a little bit of C++-20.  There's no attempt to be portable or backward
compatible beyond following good practices.  There's no obfuscating
names with `__` to avoid conflicts with other code.

Ideally, no `std` code is used.  However, `<limits>` and
`<stdexcept>` are used from `std` because it seems like a lot of work
for not much gain.

The namespace is `pw` and include files are `pw/<name>`.  Most of
the actual implementations are in `pw/impl/<file.h>`.  In fact,
most of the STL include files consist primarily of including various
implementation files.

The namespace `pw::internal` is for private details and
are in `pw/internal/<file.h>`.  These should not be used by other
code.

Unit tests are in `tests/unit/<file.t.cpp>` and use the
[catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) framework.

## How to proceed

An iterative process of writing code to implement `vector` and when that
requires other code from STL digress until that other code is done.

Depending on the complexity or need these digressions may not fully
implement the standard.

## The declaration

Here is the first step [pw_vector.h](https://github.com/peteware/vector/blob/70e44a75c0d11b116ceb7c612de9ad6cc76b9d7b/pw_vector.h):

```cpp
#ifndef PW_VECTOR_H
#define PW_VECTOR_H

namespace pw {

template<class Type, class Allocator>
class vector
{
public:
};
}

#endif /*  PW_VECTOR_H */
```

and the first digression: the `Allocator` needs a default allocator.
