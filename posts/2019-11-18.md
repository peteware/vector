# Understanding STL

I want to understand the Standard Template Library (STL) in excrutiating detail and
the best way is to implement it.  I'm starting off with `std::vector` as it is
relatively simple algorithmitically but a fundamental container.

## The declaration

Here is the first step:

```cpp
#ifndef PW_VECTOR_H
#define PW_VECTOR_H

namespace pw {

template<class Type, class Allocator>
class vector
{
public:
};
}

#endif /*  PW_VECTOR_H */
```

and my first stumbling block: the `Allocator` needs a default allocator.
